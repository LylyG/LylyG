# Hola! I'm Lyrechel 💁🏽‍♀️

I'm a bookworm turned designer that likes to code. Currently, I work at NC State University as a User Experience Developer. 

## What I do every day

I love having variety in my daily tasks and opportunities to learn. Most of time, I am [opening PRs](https://github.ncsu.edu/lngalarz) for UI I've put together using Vuetify. When I need help adding more complexity to an interface, I pair program with the other developers and we learn as a team. Sometimes, I'm called to do some graphic design, facilitate client meetings, or even teach during a [breakout session](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/2019-it-event).

## I'm passionate about
🎨  Art - I've painted a few murals in my house. I love following illustrators and other creatives on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lafoodietaina/). <br>
🍪  Food - I love to cook! Like coding, cooking is a way to show off my creativity. <br>
📚  Reading - I'm never too far from my Kindle, and most windowsills in my house have a paperback or two. <br>
